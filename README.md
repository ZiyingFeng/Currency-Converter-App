# Currency-Converter-App
In this assignment, we want you to create an iOS app that calculates the conversion from one currency to others. This assignment differs from the previous one because the exchange rates are accurate for the current date. 

Your application should include a UITextField, for the user to put the initial measurement into. It should be paired with a UILabel clarifying which units the input is in.

Below this should be a UISegmentedControl with 3 segments. Each segment should have a different currency unit that the user can convert their single input to.

Below the multi-segment controller should be a button.

When the button is clicked the interface should evaluate which segment is selected and convert the input to the appropriate unit.
